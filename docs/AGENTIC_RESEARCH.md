# Agentic Data Products: Research Initiative

## Executive Summary

This research initiative, launched in January 2025, explores the integration of small language models as "agentic sidecars" for data products within our data mesh architecture. By leveraging efficient models and the Multi-agent Cooperation Protocol (MCP), we aim to create autonomous data products that can self-manage, collaborate, and evolve with minimal human intervention while maintaining governance standards.

## Background and Motivation

Traditional data products require significant human intervention for maintenance, evolution, and cross-domain coordination. This creates operational overhead and slows responsiveness to changing business needs. Recent advances in smaller, more efficient language models create an opportunity to embed AI capabilities directly within data products, enabling a new class of "agentic data products" that can operate autonomously while coordinating through standardized protocols.

## Research Objectives

1. Evaluate the feasibility of small language models (<1B parameters) as autonomous agents for data products
2. Design and implement a sidecar architecture for agent integration with minimal resource overhead
3. Adapt the Multi-agent Cooperation Protocol (MCP) for data mesh environments
4. Develop and validate autonomous capabilities for data product management
5. Create governance frameworks for autonomous data product operation

### Component Description

1. **Agent API Client**: Interfaces with the data product, making API calls based on agent decisions
2. **Small LLM Engine**: Efficient language model for reasoning and decision making

5. **Agent Interface**: Secure API endpoint for the sidecar to interact with the data product

## Multi-agent Cooperation Protocol (MCP) for Data Mesh

### Protocol Adaptation

The Multi-agent Cooperation Protocol provides a standardized way for autonomous agents to coordinate, but requires adaptation for the data mesh context:

1. **Domain-Specific Messaging**: Extensions for data operations (schema updates, quality checks)
2. **Governance Enforcement**: Built-in governance checks and compliance verification
3. **Data Contract Validation**: Mechanisms to verify contract adherence between products
4. **Cross-Domain Operations**: Protocols for coordinating operations across domain boundaries

### Message Types

| Message Type | Purpose | Example Payload |
|--------------|---------|----------------|
| SchemaProposal | Propose schema changes | `{"schema_update": {"add_column": {"name": "risk_factor", "type": "DECIMAL(5,2)"}}}` |
| QualityAlert | Report data quality issues | `{"quality_issue": {"column": "expected_tri", "issue": "null_values", "frequency": 0.15}}` |
| QueryOptimization | Suggest query optimizations | `{"optimization": {"query_pattern": "SELECT * FROM projects WHERE status = ?", "suggestion": "ADD INDEX ON status"}}` |
| ResourceScale | Coordinate resource scaling | `{"scale_event": {"resource": "memory", "current": 512, "suggested": 1024, "reason": "large_query_trend"}}` |
| CoordinationRequest | Request cross-domain operation | `{"operation": "join_datasets", "source": "financing", "target": "risk_assessment", "join_key": "project_id"}` |

### Coordination Workflow

1. **Discovery**: Agents discover other data products through a registry
2. **Capability Exchange**: Agents share their capabilities and domain expertise
3. **Task Delegation**: Work is assigned based on domain ownership and capabilities
4. **Consensus Building**: Critical decisions require consensus from affected agents
5. **Execution**: Coordinated execution with rollback capabilities
6. **Reporting**: Results and outcomes shared with all participants

## Conclusion

The Agentic Data Products initiative represents a significant evolution in our data mesh architecture, potentially reducing operational overhead while improving adaptability and coordination. By leveraging small, efficient language models in a sidecar architecture with the Multi-agent Cooperation Protocol, we can create autonomous yet governable data products that enhance the overall data mesh ecosystem.

This research aligns with our broader strategic goals of operational efficiency, rapid adaptation to business needs, and reducing technical complexity for domain teams. The incremental approach allows us to validate benefits and address challenges while building towards a comprehensive autonomous data product framework.
